    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 25, 2026</p>

    <p>Burn Back ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Camera Data:</strong> Our app requires access to your device's camera to identify food items and analyze activities. We do not store these images on our servers or your device's permanent gallery without your explicit consent.</p>
    <p><strong>Analysis Data:</strong> When you scan an image, it is converted to a base64 string and sent to a third-party service (Google Gemini AI) for nutritional and activity analysis.</p>

    <h2>2. Use of Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p><strong>Google Gemini AI:</strong> We use Google’s Generative AI services to process images and provide calorie estimates and exercise recommendations. By using this app, you acknowledge that your images are processed by Google in accordance with their privacy standards.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>We do not maintain a remote database of your personal identity. All "Scan History" is stored locally on your device. If you delete the app, this local history will be removed.</p>

    <h2>4. Your Permissions</h2>
    <p>You may opt-out of camera permissions at any time through your device settings; however, the core functionality of the app (scanning) will be disabled.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at: [Your Email Address Here]</p>
